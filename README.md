# Hello there! <img src="https://github-readme-files.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wave.gif" height="30px" />

I am a software engineer from :singapore: Singapore currently studying at [Yale-NUS College][9] with about three years of experience in the field. I am proficient in React (TypeScript) as well as Django REST Framework among other modern web technologies, and hope to create an impact with the projects I create.

Occasionally, I write on [Medium][4] to document certain development processes I learnt along the way and on a typical day I like spending my time making random things with JavaScript and Python. Find out more about me at [leonardtng.com][1]!

### [Ape Wallpapers][10] | Create wallpapers for your Bored Ape or Mutant Ape NFTs!

Ape Wallpapers is a project done for me to explore and experiment with image manipulation, since to construct the wallpaper, I had to combine images fetched from IPFS with logos and custom text of the user's choice.

In the Ape Wallpapers web app, the process of creating mobile wallpapers of Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFTs is extremely streamlined, allowing ape holders and community members to seamlessly express their Web3 identity on their lock screens. 

At launch, the tool was very positively received by the community; reaching a peak user count of over 3000 users, as well as spawning an array of copies and similar websites from other NFT communities. Take a look at all the happy users flexing their wallpapers generated from the site on the dedicated Twitter thread [here][11]!

### [Cryptoscapes][7] | Cryptocurrency Prices, Charts and Market Overview

Cryptoscapes is a mini-project done over summer as a way for me to brush up my development skills with React, and also learn the state management tool, Redux. Additionally, I also used this as a chance to try out atomic design and also proper project management best practices. 

In Cryptoscapes, you can view Cryptocurrency prices, trends, status updates, market snapshots and many more visualisations in a clean, informative dashboard!
